Firmware for the Hand-wired 3D Printed WhiteFox from the following model

Matt3o never released his guide for building firmware for this project,
so I made what I could from the chibios work already done in the qmk repo.

This uses a Teensy 3.2 like suggested in Matt3o's guide for making and wiring
this board.

Not fully tested yet. Made the keymap as close to the standard WhiteFox:TrueFox
layout and keymap as I could.
